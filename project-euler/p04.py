# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
# The largest palindrome made from the product of 
# two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product 
# of two 3-digit numbers.
#
# The largest 3 digit number is 999. Start there. 
# To read a palindromic number, we need to read the 
# number string forwards and backwards and see if they match. 
# We also need to decrement x and y logically for every
# non match. 990 * 999 may make a number, but 998 * 998 is a 
# bigger number. 
# Need to calculate the sum, and only reduce y when the product of
# the next xy calculation will be less than if we reduced y. 
# First take 999 * 999 = 998,001.
#            998 * 999 = 997,002.
#            997 * 999 = 996,003.
#            998 * 998 = 996,004.
# Reduce x until we find a palindrome. 
# Then reduce y by one
# Iterate through x trying to find a palindrome larger than the previous.
# We won't have to go past the previous iteration
